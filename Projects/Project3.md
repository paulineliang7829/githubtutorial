# Project 3: Updating Code for Docstrings and PEP8
In this project, students will take their code from Project 2 and make it satisfy Python PEP8 standards and include docstrings that follow the [Google example](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html) that are [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) compatible.

1. Install a Python PEP8 linter in your text editor. For Sublime Text, you can install the [SublimeLinter](http://www.sublimelinter.com/en/stable/) package. And for Atom, you can install the [linter-python](https://atom.io/packages/linter-python) package.
2. Install the [`black`](https://pypi.org/project/black/) package for Python
3. Update and improve your the PEP8 compliance of your code from Project 2, and submit a pull request for the change.
4. Update the docstrings in your code from Project 2. They should follow the [Google standard](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html) for Python docstrings. This is also compatible with [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) documentation
5. Produce a `readthedocs` webpage of [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) documentation for your code.
